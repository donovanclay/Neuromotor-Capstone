### Please run it on macOS/Linux/WSL.

## Creating a Python Virtual Environment
```shell
    python -m venv 481-team1-capstone
    source 481-team1-capstone/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the GUI
```shell
    python ./Neuromotor_GUI_2.4.py
```
If that doesn't work, try
```shell
    python3 ./Neuromotor_GUI_2.4.py
```

## Running the Jupyter Notebook
Ignore the evaluate_paper_accuracy.ipynb notebook. It's a little outdated. <br>
#### Open the notebook in VSCode and select `481-team1-capstone` as the kernel.


## When you're all done
### Deleting Python Virtual Environment
```shell
rm -rf 481-team1-capstone

```
